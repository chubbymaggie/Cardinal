# Folder structure

Ex: "lin_clang_o2_corpus" is all the Linux AMD64 binaries compiled from each source with clang at optimization O2, etc. The projects we compile are mostly found in the source folder, but we also used some freely available from the [LLVM test-suite](http://llvm.org/releases/3.7.1/test-suite-3.7.1.src.tar.xz) Please follow the documentation at LLVM.org to compile the test-suite.

# Downloading binaries

To download the corpora as a tarballed gzip, proceed to this repo: https://bitbucket.org/ltjones18/cardinal-corpora/
